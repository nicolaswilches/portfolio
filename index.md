# Nicolás Higuera Wilches

MSc in Business Analytics & Data Science. I use data to answer business questions, build models, and communicate insights clearly.

I’m especially interested in time series forecasting, energy systems, and turning messy datasets into useful, actionable insights.

## Other Projects

More projects coming soon. I’m currently working on adding:

- An end-to-end analytical project with data cleaning, EDA, and clear business recommendations.
- A modeling project (classification or regression) with feature engineering and model comparison.
- A visualization-heavy project focused on communicating insights.

## About This Portfolio

This site is built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, using a simple, clean structure:

- **Projects** are written as case studies, not just code dumps.
- Each project page explains:
  - The problem
  - The data
  - The approach
  - The results
  - The business or practical implications

The goal is to show not only that I can write code, but that I can think like a data scientist: frame problems, choose methods, and communicate conclusions.
